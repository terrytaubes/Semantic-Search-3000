Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a free open-source software project specific for data stream mining with concept drift. It is written in Java and developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand.


== Description ==
MOA is an open-source framework software that allows to build and run experiments of machine learning or data mining on evolving data streams. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that can be used from the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the command-line, and the Java API. MOA contains several collections of machine learning algorithms:
Classification
Bayesian classifiers
Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes Multinomial

Decision trees classifiers
Decision Stump
Hoeffding Tree
Hoeffding Option Tree
Hoeffding Adaptive Tree

Meta classifiers
Bagging
Boosting
Bagging using ADWIN
Bagging using Adaptive-Size Hoeffding Trees.
Perceptron Stacking of Restricted Hoeffding Trees
Leveraging Bagging
Online Accuracy Updated Ensemble

These algorithms are designed for large scale machine learning, dealing with concept drift, and big data streams in real time.
MOA supports bi-directional interaction with Weka (machine learning). MOA is free software released under the GNU GPL.

Audi is a member of the Volkswagen Group and has its roots at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced in nine production facilities worldwide.\nThe origins of the company are complex, going back to the early 20th century and the initial enterprises (Horch and the Audiwerke) founded by engineer August Horch; and two other manufacturers (DKW and Wanderer), leading to the foundation of Auto Union in 1932. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the 1960s when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from Daimler-Benz.[9] After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi F103 series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with NSU Motorenwerke in 1969, thus creating the present day form of the company.\nThe company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, August Horch. \"Horch\", meaning \"listen\" in German, becomes \"audi\" in Latin. The four rings of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, Auto Union. Audi's slogan is Vorsprung durch Technik, meaning \"Advancement through Technology\". However, Audi USA had used the slogan \"Truth in Engineering\" from 2007 to 2016, and have not used the slogan since 2016.[10] Audi, along with BMW and Mercedes-Benz, are among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.[11]\n", "tokens": ["audi", "ag", "(pronounced", "(about", "this", "sound", "listen))", "is", "german", "automobile", "manufacturer", "that", "designs,", "engineers,", "produces,", "market", "distributes", "luxury", "vehicles.", "audi", "is", "member", "volkswagen", "group", "ha", "it", "root", "at", "ingolstadt,", "bavaria,", "germany.", "audi-branded", "vehicle", "are", "produced", "nine", "production", "facility", "worldwide.", "origin", "company", "are", "complex,", "going", "back", "early", "20th", "century", "initial", "enterprise", "(horch", "audiwerke)", "founded", "by", "engineer", "august", "horch;", "two", "other", "manufacturer", "(dkw", "wanderer),", "leading", "foundation", "auto", "union", "1932.", "modern", "era", "audi", "essentially", "began", "1960s", "when", "auto", "union", "wa", "acquired", "by", "volkswagen", "from", "daimler-benz.[9]", "after", "relaunching", "audi", "brand", "with", "1965", "introduction", "audi", "f103", "series,", "volkswagen", "merged", "auto", "union", "with", "nsu", "motorenwerke", "1969,", "thus", "creating", "present", "day", "form", "company.", "company", "name", "is", "based", "on", "latin", "translation", "surname", "founder,", "august", "horch.", "\"horch\",", "meaning", "\"listen\"", "german,", "becomes", "\"audi\"", "latin.", "four", "ring", "audi", "logo", "each", "represent", "one", "four", "car", "company", "that", "banded", "together", "create", "audi's", "predecessor", "company,", "auto", "union.", "audi's", "slogan", "is", "vorsprung", "durch", "technik,", "meaning", "\"advancement", "through", "technology\".", "however,", "audi", "usa", "had", "used", "slogan", "\"truth", "engineering\"", "from", "2007", "2016,", "have", "not", "used", "slogan", "since", "2016.[10]", "audi,", "along", "with", "bmw", "mercedes-benz,", "are", "among", "best-selling", "luxury", "automobile", "brand", "world.[11]"]}, "BaldEagleWiki.txt": {"index": 0, "text": "The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus, from Greek hali \"sea\", ai\u0113tos \"eagle\", leuco \"white\", cephalos \"head\") is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight.[2] Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.\nBald eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white headed\". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.\nThe bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.\n", "tokens": ["bald", "eagle", "(haliaeetus", "leucocephalus,", "from", "greek", "hali", "\"sea\",", "\"eagle\",", "leuco", "\"white\",", "cephalos", "\"head\")", "is", "bird", "prey", "found", "north", "america.", "sea", "eagle,", "it", "ha", "two", "known", "subspecies", "form", "specie", "pair", "with", "white-tailed", "eagle", "(haliaeetus", "albicilla).", "it", "range", "includes", "most", "canada", "alaska,", "all", "contiguous", "united", "states,", "northern", "mexico.", "it", "is", "found", "near", "large", "body", "open", "water", "with", "an", "abundant", "food", "supply", "old-growth", "tree", "nesting.", "bald", "eagle", "is", "an", "opportunistic", "feeder", "which", "subsists", "mainly", "on", "fish,", "which", "it", "swoop", "down", "snatch", "from", "water", "with", "it", "talons.", "it", "build", "largest", "nest", "any", "north", "american", "bird", "largest", "tree", "nest", "ever", "recorded", "any", "animal", "species,", "up", "4", "m", "(13", "ft)", "deep,", "2.5", "m", "(8.2", "ft)", "wide,", "1", "metric", "ton", "(1.1", "short", "tons)", "weight.[2]", "sexual", "maturity", "is", "attained", "at", "age", "four", "five", "years.", "bald", "eagle", "are", "not", "actually", "bald;", "name", "derives", "from", "an", "older", "meaning", "word,", "\"white", "headed\".", "adult", "is", "mainly", "brown", "with", "white", "head", "tail.", "sex", "are", "identical", "plumage,", "but", "female", "are", "about", "25", "percent", "larger", "than", "males.", "beak", "is", "large", "hooked.", "plumage", "immature", "is", "brown.", "bald", "eagle", "is", "both", "national", "bird", "national", "animal", "united", "state", "america.", "bald", "eagle", "appears", "on", "it", "seal.", "late", "20th", "century", "it", "wa", "on", "brink", "extirpation", "contiguous", "united", "states.", "population", "have", "since", "recovered", "specie", "wa", "removed", "from", "u.s.", "government's", "list", "endangered", "specie", "on", "july", "12,", "1995", "transferred", "list", "threatened", "species.", "it", "wa", "removed", "from", "list", "endangered", "threatened", "wildlife", "lower", "48", "state", "on", "june", "28,", "2007."]}, "BaseballWiki.txt": {"index": 8, "text": "Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and touches home plate.\nPlayers on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\nIn the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.\nThe World Baseball Classic, organised by WBSB, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n", "tokens": ["baseball", "is", "bat-and-ball", "game", "played", "between", "two", "team", "nine", "player", "each", "who", "take", "turn", "batting", "fielding.", "batting", "team", "attempt", "score", "run", "by", "hitting", "ball", "(that", "is", "thrown", "by", "opposing", "team's", "pitcher)", "with", "bat", "swung", "by", "batter,", "then", "running", "counter-clockwise", "around", "series", "four", "bases:", "first,", "second,", "third,", "home", "plate.", "run", "is", "scored", "when", "player", "advance", "around", "base", "touch", "home", "plate.", "player", "on", "batting", "team", "take", "turn", "hitting", "against", "pitcher", "fielding", "team,", "which", "try", "prevent", "run", "by", "getting", "hitter", "out", "any", "several", "ways.", "player", "on", "batting", "team", "who", "reach", "base", "safely", "can", "later", "attempt", "advance", "subsequent", "base", "during", "teammates'", "turn", "batting,", "such", "a", "on", "hit", "or", "by", "other", "means.", "team", "switch", "between", "batting", "fielding", "whenever", "fielding", "team", "record", "three", "outs.", "one", "turn", "batting", "both", "teams,", "beginning", "with", "visiting", "team,", "constitutes", "an", "inning.", "game", "is", "composed", "nine", "innings,", "team", "with", "greater", "number", "run", "at", "end", "game", "wins.", "if", "score", "are", "tied", "at", "end", "nine", "innings,", "extra", "inning", "are", "usually", "played.", "baseball", "ha", "no", "game", "clock,", "although", "most", "game", "end", "ninth", "inning.", "baseball", "evolved", "from", "older", "bat-and-ball", "game", "already", "being", "played", "england", "by", "mid-18th", "century.", "this", "game", "wa", "brought", "by", "immigrant", "north", "america,", "where", "modern", "version", "developed.", "by", "late", "19th", "century,", "baseball", "wa", "widely", "recognized", "a", "national", "sport", "united", "states.", "baseball", "is", "currently", "popular", "north", "america", "part", "central", "south", "america,", "caribbean,", "east", "asia,", "particularly", "japan,", "south", "korea,", "taiwan.", "united", "state", "canada,", "professional", "major", "league", "baseball", "(mlb)", "team", "are", "divided", "into", "national", "league", "(nl)", "american", "league", "(al),", "each", "with", "three", "divisions:", "east,", "west,", "central.", "major", "league", "champion", "is", "determined", "by", "playoff", "that", "culminate", "world", "series.", "top", "level", "play", "is", "similarly", "split", "japan", "between", "central", "pacific", "league", "cuba", "between", "west", "league", "east", "league.", "world", "baseball", "classic,", "organised", "by", "wbsb,", "is", "major", "international", "competition", "sport", "attracts", "top", "national", "team", "from", "around", "world."]}, "BeefWiki.txt": {"index": 2, "text": "Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and essential nutrients.[2]\nBeef skeletal muscle meat can be cut into roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.). Some cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky), and trimmings, usually mixed with meat from older, leaner cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties of blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as-is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.\nBeef from steers and heifers is very similar. According to the most recent National Beef Quality Audit,[when?] heifer carcasses had slightly more marbling than steer carcasses, but USDA quality grade was not significantly different.[3] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.\nBeef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[4] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.\nCows are considered sacred in the Hinduism and most observant Hindus who do eat meat almost always abstain from beef.\nIn 2015, the world's largest exporters of beef, (including buffalo meat), were India (buffalo meat only), Brazil and Australia.[5][6] Beef production is also important to the economies of Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Argentina, Belarus and Nicaragua.\n", "tokens": ["beef", "is", "culinary", "name", "meat", "from", "cattle,", "particularly", "skeletal", "muscle.", "human", "have", "been", "eating", "beef", "since", "prehistoric", "times.[1]", "beef", "is", "source", "high-quality", "protein", "essential", "nutrients.[2]", "beef", "skeletal", "muscle", "meat", "can", "be", "cut", "into", "roasts,", "short", "rib", "or", "steak", "(filet", "mignon,", "sirloin", "steak,", "rump", "steak,", "rib", "steak,", "rib", "eye", "steak,", "hanger", "steak,", "etc.).", "some", "cut", "are", "processed", "(corned", "beef", "or", "beef", "jerky),", "trimmings,", "usually", "mixed", "with", "meat", "from", "older,", "leaner", "cattle,", "are", "ground,", "minced", "or", "used", "sausages.", "blood", "is", "used", "some", "variety", "blood", "sausage.", "other", "part", "that", "are", "eaten", "include", "other", "muscle", "offal,", "such", "a", "oxtail,", "liver,", "tongue,", "tripe", "from", "reticulum", "or", "rumen,", "gland", "(particularly", "pancreas", "thymus,", "referred", "a", "sweetbread),", "heart,", "brain", "(although", "forbidden", "where", "there", "is", "danger", "bovine", "spongiform", "encephalopathy,", "bse),", "kidneys,", "tender", "testicle", "bull", "(known", "united", "state", "a", "calf", "fries,", "prairie", "oysters,", "or", "rocky", "mountain", "oysters).", "some", "intestine", "are", "cooked", "eaten", "as-is,", "but", "are", "more", "often", "cleaned", "used", "a", "natural", "sausage", "casings.", "bone", "are", "used", "making", "beef", "stock.", "beef", "from", "steer", "heifer", "is", "very", "similar.", "according", "most", "recent", "national", "beef", "quality", "audit,[when?]", "heifer", "carcass", "had", "slightly", "more", "marbling", "than", "steer", "carcasses,", "but", "usda", "quality", "grade", "wa", "not", "significantly", "different.[3]", "depending", "on", "economics,", "number", "heifer", "kept", "breeding", "varies.", "meat", "from", "older", "bull", "is", "usually", "tougher,", "so", "it", "is", "frequently", "used", "mince", "(known", "a", "ground", "beef", "united", "states).", "cattle", "raised", "beef", "may", "be", "allowed", "roam", "free", "on", "grasslands,", "or", "may", "be", "confined", "at", "some", "stage", "pen", "a", "part", "large", "feeding", "operation", "called", "feedlot", "(or", "concentrated", "animal", "feeding", "operation),", "where", "they", "are", "usually", "fed", "ration", "grain,", "protein,", "roughage", "vitamin/mineral", "preblend.", "beef", "is", "third", "most", "widely", "consumed", "meat", "world,", "accounting", "about", "25%", "meat", "production", "worldwide,", "after", "pork", "poultry", "at", "38%", "30%", "respectively.[4]", "absolute", "numbers,", "united", "states,", "brazil,", "people's", "republic", "china", "are", "world's", "three", "largest", "consumer", "beef;", "uruguay,", "however,", "ha", "highest", "beef", "veal", "consumption", "per", "capita,", "followed", "by", "argentina", "brazil.", "according", "data", "from", "oecd,", "average", "uruguayan", "ate", "over", "42", "kg", "(93", "lb)", "beef", "or", "veal", "2014,", "representing", "highest", "beef/veal", "consumption", "per", "caput", "world.", "comparison,", "average", "american", "consumed", "only", "about", "24", "kg", "(53", "lb)", "beef", "or", "veal", "same", "year,", "while", "african", "countries,", "such", "a", "mozambique,", "ghana,", "nigeria,", "consumed", "least", "beef", "or", "veal", "per", "capita.", "cow", "are", "considered", "sacred", "hinduism", "most", "observant", "hindu", "who", "do", "eat", "meat", "almost", "always", "abstain", "from", "beef.", "2015,", "world's", "largest", "exporter", "beef,", "(including", "buffalo", "meat),", "were", "india", "(buffalo", "meat", "only),", "brazil", "australia.[5][6]", "beef", "production", "is", "also", "important", "economy", "uruguay,", "canada,", "paraguay,", "mexico,", "argentina,", "belarus", "nicaragua."]}, "ChevroletCamaroWiki.txt": {"index": 1, "text": "The Chevrolet Camaro is an American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car[1][2] and some versions also as a muscle car.[3][4] It went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang.

Louis Chevrolet and ousted General Motors founder William C. Durant started the company on November 3, 1911 [2] as the Chevrolet Motor Car Company. Durant used the Chevrolet Motor Car Company to acquire a controlling stake in General Motors with a reverse merger occurring on May 2, 1918 and propelled himself back to the GM presidency. After Durant's second ousting in 1919, Alfred Sloan, with his maxim \"a car for every purse and purpose,\" would pick the Chevrolet brand to become the volume leader in the General Motors family, selling mainstream vehicles to compete with Henry Ford's Model T in 1919 and overtaking Ford as the best-selling car in the United States by 1929.[3]\nChevrolet-branded vehicles are sold in most automotive markets worldwide, with the notable exception of Oceania, where GM is represented by its Australian subsidiary, Holden. In 2005, Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe, primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline \"Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet\", a move rooted in General Motors' attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet. With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe, GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand, while GM's traditional European standard-bearers, Opel of Germany, and Vauxhall of United Kingdom would be moved upmarket.[4] However, GM reversed this move in late 2013, announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe, with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette[5] in 2016. Chevrolet vehicles will continue to be marketed in the CIS states, including Russia. After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in 2011 to create GM Korea, the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet.\nIn North America, Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles, from subcompact automobiles to medium-duty commercial trucks. Due to the prominence and name recognition of Chevrolet as one of General Motors' global marques, Chevrolet, Chevy or Chev is used at times as a synonym for General Motors or its products, one example being the GM LS1 engine, commonly known by the name or a variant thereof of its progenitor, the Chevrolet small-block engine.\n", "tokens": ["chevrolet", "colloquially", "referred", "a", "chevy", "formally", "chevrolet", "division", "general", "motor", "company,", "is", "an", "american", "automobile", "division", "american", "manufacturer", "general", "motor", "(gm).", "louis", "chevrolet", "ousted", "general", "motor", "founder", "william", "c.", "durant", "started", "company", "on", "november", "3,", "1911", "[2]", "a", "chevrolet", "motor", "car", "company.", "durant", "used", "chevrolet", "motor", "car", "company", "acquire", "controlling", "stake", "general", "motor", "with", "reverse", "merger", "occurring", "on", "may", "2,", "1918", "propelled", "himself", "back", "gm", "presidency.", "after", "durant's", "second", "ousting", "1919,", "alfred", "sloan,", "with", "his", "maxim", "\"a", "car", "every", "purse", "purpose,\"", "would", "pick", "chevrolet", "brand", "become", "volume", "leader", "general", "motor", "family,", "selling", "mainstream", "vehicle", "compete", "with", "henry", "ford's", "model", "t", "1919", "overtaking", "ford", "a", "best-selling", "car", "united", "state", "by", "1929.[3]", "chevrolet-branded", "vehicle", "are", "sold", "most", "automotive", "market", "worldwide,", "with", "notable", "exception", "oceania,", "where", "gm", "is", "represented", "by", "it", "australian", "subsidiary,", "holden.", "2005,", "chevrolet", "wa", "relaunched", "europe,", "primarily", "selling", "vehicle", "built", "by", "gm", "daewoo", "south", "korea", "with", "tagline", "\"daewoo", "ha", "grown", "up", "enough", "become", "chevrolet\",", "move", "rooted", "general", "motors'", "attempt", "build", "global", "brand", "around", "chevrolet.", "with", "reintroduction", "chevrolet", "europe,", "gm", "intended", "chevrolet", "be", "mainstream", "value", "brand,", "while", "gm's", "traditional", "european", "standard-bearers,", "opel", "germany,", "vauxhall", "united", "kingdom", "would", "be", "moved", "upmarket.[4]", "however,", "gm", "reversed", "this", "move", "late", "2013,", "announcing", "that", "brand", "would", "be", "withdrawn", "from", "europe,", "with", "exception", "camaro", "corvette[5]", "2016.", "chevrolet", "vehicle", "will", "continue", "be", "marketed", "ci", "states,", "including", "russia.", "after", "general", "motor", "fully", "acquired", "gm", "daewoo", "2011", "create", "gm", "korea,", "last", "usage", "daewoo", "automotive", "brand", "wa", "discontinued", "it", "native", "south", "korea", "succeeded", "by", "chevrolet.", "north", "america,", "chevrolet", "produce", "sell", "wide", "range", "vehicles,", "from", "subcompact", "automobile", "medium-duty", "commercial", "trucks.", "due", "prominence", "name", "recognition", "chevrolet", "a", "one", "general", "motors'", "global", "marques,", "chevrolet,", "chevy", "or", "chev", "is", "used", "at", "time", "a", "synonym", "general", "motor", "or", "it", "products,", "one", "example", "being", "gm", "ls1", "engine,", "commonly", "known", "by", "name", "or", "variant", "thereof", "it", "progenitor,", "chevrolet", "small-block", "engine."]}, "HamburgerWiki.txt": {"index": 9, "text": "A hamburger, beefburger or burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun.

It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.\nPlayers are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play, unless they are goalkeepers (and then only when within their penalty area). Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863.

Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.\nTennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as \"lawn tennis\".[1] It had close connections both to various field (\"lawn\") games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport of real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term \"tennis\" referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will \"go down to Hampton Court and play tennis.\"[2]\nThe rules of tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.\nTennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the \"Majors\") are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts.\n", "tokens": ["tennis", "is", "racket", "sport", "that", "can", "be", "played", "individually", "against", "single", "opponent", "(singles)", "or", "between", "two", "team", "two", "player", "each", "(doubles).", "each", "player", "us", "tennis", "racket", "that", "is", "strung", "with", "cord", "strike", "hollow", "rubber", "ball", "covered", "with", "felt", "over", "or", "around", "net", "into", "opponent's", "court.", "object", "game", "is", "play", "ball", "such", "way", "that", "opponent", "is", "not", "able", "play", "valid", "return.", "player", "who", "is", "unable", "return", "ball", "will", "not", "gain", "point,", "while", "opposite", "player", "will.", "tennis", "is", "an", "olympic", "sport", "is", "played", "at", "all", "level", "society", "at", "all", "ages.", "sport", "can", "be", "played", "by", "anyone", "who", "can", "hold", "racket,", "including", "wheelchair", "users.", "modern", "game", "tennis", "originated", "birmingham,", "england,", "late", "19th", "century", "a", "\"lawn", "tennis\".[1]", "it", "had", "close", "connection", "both", "various", "field", "(\"lawn\")", "game", "such", "a", "croquet", "bowl", "a", "well", "a", "older", "racket", "sport", "real", "tennis.", "during", "most", "19th", "century,", "fact,", "term", "\"tennis\"", "referred", "real", "tennis,", "not", "lawn", "tennis:", "example,", "disraeli's", "novel", "sybil", "(1845),", "lord", "eugene", "de", "vere", "announces", "that", "he", "will", "\"go", "down", "hampton", "court", "play", "tennis.\"[2]", "rule", "tennis", "have", "changed", "little", "since", "1890s.", "two", "exception", "are", "that", "from", "1908", "1961", "server", "had", "keep", "one", "foot", "on", "ground", "at", "all", "times,", "adoption", "tiebreak", "1970s.", "recent", "addition", "professional", "tennis", "ha", "been", "adoption", "electronic", "review", "technology", "coupled", "with", "point", "challenge", "system,", "which", "allows", "player", "contest", "line", "call", "point,", "system", "known", "a", "hawk-eye.", "tennis", "is", "played", "by", "million", "recreational", "player", "is", "also", "popular", "worldwide", "spectator", "sport.", "four", "grand", "slam", "tournament", "(also", "referred", "a", "\"majors\")", "are", "especially", "popular:", "australian", "open", "played", "on", "hard", "courts,", "french", "open", "played", "on", "red", "clay", "courts,", "wimbledon", "played", "on", "grass", "courts,", "u", "open", "played", "also", "on", "hard", "courts."]}}
